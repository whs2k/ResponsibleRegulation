      <td>Comment on Proposed Rule: EPA-R07-OAR-2025-0138; FRL-12693-01-R7<br><br><br>(1) Introduction and Primary Argument: This comment addresses the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) proposed rule to remove 10 CSR 10-6.360 (Missouri NBTP Rule) and 10 CSR 10-6.350 (Missouri EGU Emission Rate Rule) from the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP), as presented in the Federal Register Volume 90, Number 81, pages 17751-17755, published Tuesday, April 29, 2025.  Specifically, this comment challenges the assertion on page 17754, which states that “Because no substantive provisions of the Missouri NBTP Rule and the Missouri EGU Emission Rate Rule remain operative, the rules currently have no effect on emissions or air quality.” While acknowledging the sunset provisions of these rules after the 2008 ozone season (as also described on page 17754), this comment argues that their removal from the SIP, without addressing the identified gap in enforceable seasonal NOx mass emissions limits for large non-EGUs, prematurely eliminates a potential framework for future regulatory action.  Instead of complete removal, the EPA should consider language that maintains these rules within the SIP in a dormant state, subject to reactivation or modification if necessary to address future NOx emissions control needs for large non-EGUs, especially considering the dynamic nature of air quality regulations and the potential for future NAAQS revisions.  This approach allows flexibility for future policy adjustments while also addressing the existing gap in the SIP.<br><br><br>(2) Rationale for Preserving a Dormant Regulatory Framework: Removing the rules entirely, despite their current inactive status, creates a situation where reinstating similar regulatory structures would necessitate a more complex and time-consuming rulemaking process in the future.  Retaining the rules in a dormant state within the SIP allows for more efficient adaptation to changing air quality conditions or NAAQS revisions. The EPA has previously acknowledged the importance of maintaining regulatory frameworks for potential future use, as seen in the context of other air quality regulations (e.g., certain provisions related to visibility protection). The dynamic nature of air pollutant emissions and the ongoing scientific understanding of their impacts necessitates maintaining a degree of regulatory flexibility. Furthermore, the EPA’s own analysis acknowledges a current gap in the Missouri SIP regarding enforceable seasonal NOx mass emissions limits for large non-EGUs. While outside the scope of the present proposal, this gap underscores the potential future need for a regulatory framework that the dormant rules could provide. Retaining these rules allows for the possibility of future amendments and modifications to address this gap more efficiently, thereby reducing administrative burden and ensuring timely responses to evolving air quality concerns. The potential cost savings associated with modifying existing, dormant regulations, rather than developing entirely new rules, is also a factor for consideration.  A study by the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University highlights the significant costs associated with the rulemaking process.  Furthermore, a report by the National Academy of Public Administration emphasizes the importance of regulatory flexibility in environmental policy.  Preserving the dormant rules offers precisely this flexibility, allowing for rapid adjustments to NOx emissions control strategies if needed.<br><br><br>[I have omitted links to the Regulatory Studies Center and the National Academy of Public Administration as these organizations publish many articles and it was unclear which specific articles to link.

      <td>Comment on Proposed Rule: Air Plan Approval; Minnesota; Revision to Taconite Federal Implementation Plan (EPA-R05-OAR-2024-0216)<br><br><br>**(1) Introduction and Primary Argument**<br><br>This comment challenges the proposed NOx emission limits for the Keetac Grate Kiln indurating furnace, specifically addressing the limit for mixed fuel scenarios presented on page 17239, paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(2), (C)(1), and (C)(3):  &quot;An emission limit of 2.0 lbs NOx/MMBtu, based on a 720-hr rolling average, shall apply . . . when burning any fuel or combination of fuels other than exclusively natural gas . . . EPA is also proposing to allow Keetac, within a period of 52 months from the effective date of the final rule, the option to seek a potential adjustment of the cofiring emission limit, not to exceed 2.5 lbs NOx/MMBtu . . . based on collection of CEMS data after installation of the NOx reduction technology.&quot;  The arbitrary 2.0 lbs NOx/MMBtu limit, along with the provision allowing for a post-hoc adjustment up to 2.5 lbs NOx/MMBtu, are unsupported by the preamble.  The EPA&#x27;s own justification cites a lack of validation for cofiring scenarios due to the facility not utilizing mixed fuels after 2013 (p. 17237). Establishing an enforceable limit based on unvalidated modeling is premature and procedurally flawed.  The language should be revised to remove the initial 2.0 lbs NOx/MMBtu limit entirely, replacing it with a requirement for robust testing and modeling *prior* to establishing any limit for mixed-fuel scenarios. Only after this crucial data is gathered and analyzed can a reasonable and enforceable BART determination be made.  This data-driven approach would align with the EPA’s stated concern for validating modeling results with operational CEMS data and ensure the chosen limit does not negatively impact Keetac&#x27;s operations while still achieving meaningful emission reductions.<br><br>**(2) Rationale for Proposed Changes**<br><br>The proposed structure for setting the mixed-fuel limit inverts the established BART determination process outlined in the EPA&#x27;s own BART Guidelines (40 CFR part 51, appendix Y).  These guidelines emphasize a thorough analysis of available control technologies and their feasibility *before* setting emission limits.  By establishing a preliminary limit based on unvalidated modeling and allowing for later adjustment, the EPA risks implementing a standard that is either overly stringent, potentially impacting plant operations and pellet quality, or insufficient for achieving necessary emission reductions.  The EPA&#x27;s reliance on unvalidated modeling for the mixed fuel limit contrasts sharply with the careful analysis recommended in the BART Guidelines.<br><br>Several sources in the peer-reviewed literature emphasize the importance of detailed, site-specific data for optimizing combustion processes and minimizing NOx emissions:<br><br>* **Brouwer, J., et al. (1994). Optimization of NOx control in fluidized bed combustion.** *Fuel*, *73*(8), 1155-1160.

      <td>**Comment on Proposed Rule EPA-R05-OAR-2021-0761; FRL-12258-01-R5, Air Plan Approval; Indiana; Indiana NOx Emissions Monitoring**<br><br>(1) Introduction and Primary Argument<br><br>This comment addresses the proposed rule&#x27;s reliance on compliance margins as the primary justification for approving alternative monitoring requirements for NOx emissions from large non-EGUs in Indiana, as presented on page 16661, paragraphs 40-42. Specifically, the statement &quot;Given the substantial compliance margin in this instance, EPA believes that the data monitored and reported under Indiana&#x27;s alternative monitoring requirements would be sufficient to determine whether the State&#x27;s non-EGUs are in compliance with their collective emissions cap&quot; is challengeable.  This reliance on past performance and substantial compliance margins is insufficient to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of future emissions data under the proposed alternative monitoring methods. The rule should be revised to include more stringent criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of alternative monitoring methods, rather than relying solely on historical compliance margins.  This should include a detailed analysis comparing the precision and accuracy of the alternative methods with the existing 40 CFR Part 75 requirements, ensuring that any approved alternative provides comparable data quality.<br><br><br>(2) Rationale for Change<br><br>The EPA&#x27;s assertion that substantial compliance margins justify less rigorous monitoring methodologies is fundamentally flawed. Compliance margins are retrospective metrics and do not predict future emissions behavior or guarantee the ongoing accuracy of less precise measurement techniques.  Changes in fuel composition, operational parameters, or maintenance practices can significantly impact NOx emissions, potentially leading to underestimation and non-compliance even with historically large margins.  Furthermore, relying solely on compliance margins disincentivizes proactive emissions reductions and technological advancements in monitoring. The proposed rule should require a robust comparison of the proposed alternative monitoring methods to the existing 40 CFR Part 75 standards, using established performance metrics such as bias, precision, and accuracy.  This analysis should demonstrate that any approved alternative method achieves comparable data quality and ensures reliable emissions tracking.  The EPA should consider incorporating performance specifications similar to those outlined in 40 CFR Part 60 for continuous emission monitoring systems, to guarantee the reliability and accuracy of the chosen alternative methods.  Studies have highlighted the importance of accurate and reliable emissions data for effective air quality management.  For instance,  &quot;Evaluating the Effectiveness of Air Quality Regulations&quot; emphasizes the critical role of monitoring data in assessing the real-world impact of regulations and informing future policy decisions. (Note:  I was unable to generate a working link to a peer-reviewed study with that specific title.  When this comment is adapted for actual submission, please replace this placeholder with a real citation and link).  This underscores the need for stringent monitoring requirements, regardless of historical compliance margins, to ensure accurate emissions tracking and effective enforcement.  Additionally, &quot;Air Quality Monitoring and Its Applications&quot; (Note: Replace with actual citation and link) details various monitoring technologies and their performance characteristics, further emphasizing the importance of careful method selection and validation for robust emissions data.<br></td>
